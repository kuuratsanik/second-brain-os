# AI Second Brain

Forked from [undefined-ui/second-brain-os](https://github.com/undefined-ui/second-brain-os), MIT licensed.

A knowledge base that an AI agent builds and maintains for you, in plain
markdown files you own. Everything you read, watch and save gets turned into
linked wiki pages, connected to everything already there, and you can ask it
questions.

This repo is the full version of the guide: the concepts, the setup, the vault
template, the agent skills, the scripts, and the resources. Free, no signup,
nothing to install beyond Obsidian, an agent, git and Python 3 (the template's
safety hook is a Python script).

**Read it on the web:** [kuuratsanik.github.io/second-brain-os](https://kuuratsanik.github.io/second-brain-os/) — the full guide with search and navigation, plus [every vetted link](https://kuuratsanik.github.io/second-brain-os/resources.html) in one filterable page.

Three things live here — pick your entrance:

- **[The second-brain guide](#the-guide)** — a path you follow once: build a knowledge base an agent maintains for you. 65 pages, a starter vault, 29 skills.
- **[The agents course](#the-agents-course)** — a path you read in order: seven modules from a single prompt to a production agent, with [tools you install in two commands](plugins/README.md).
- **[The handbooks](#the-handbooks)** — not a path, references: the full menu of techniques, tools and builds for one layer. Open one when that layer starts hurting.

## The problem it solves

You save things with the intention of coming back. You never do. Bookmarks,
screenshots, read-later queues and half-filled Notion pages accumulate without
compounding, because filing and linking them is boring work that humans stop
doing after two weeks.

Hand that work to an agent and the system stays alive. That is the whole idea.

## Quickstart

One evening. Nine steps, each with a full page behind it.

You need git, Python 3, Obsidian and an agent such as Claude Code. Check that
`python3 --version` prints a version. On a Mac, `/usr/bin/python3` is one of Apple's developer-tool shims
([TN2339](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html)); if `python3 --version` asks to install the Command Line Tools instead of printing a version, accept, or install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The vault's guard hook runs `python3`, and a hook that cannot start blocks nothing.

```bash
# copy the starter vault, skills, commands and agents
git clone https://github.com/kuuratsanik/second-brain-os.git
cp -r second-brain-os/vault-template ~/brain

mkdir -p ~/brain/.claude
cp -r second-brain-os/skills   ~/brain/.claude/skills
cp -r second-brain-os/commands ~/brain/.claude/commands
cp -r second-brain-os/agents   ~/brain/.claude/agents
mkdir -p ~/brain/scripts
cp second-brain-os/scripts/{chat_export_to_md,dashboard,graph_export,link_check,vault_search,vault_stats}.py ~/brain/scripts/

# the folder READMEs are for reading on GitHub, not for the agent
rm ~/brain/.claude/*/README.md

# make the vault its own git repository, once, and commit the template
cd ~/brain
git init
git add .gitignore CLAUDE.md README.md templates wiki projects output journal archive raw .obsidian \
  .claude/settings.json .claude/hooks .claude/skills .claude/commands .claude/agents scripts
git commit -m "Initial vault"

# check that the guard hook runs: it should end with "N/N passed"
python3 .claude/hooks/test_guard.py

claude
```

Do not trust the safety rails until the last check prints "N/N passed". On
Windows, see the next section.

### Windows

The block above is bash. Run it in Git Bash (installed with [Git for
Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) and it works unchanged, except that
`python3` may be the Microsoft Store stub: use `python` or `py` for the check,
and change `python3` to `python` or `py` in the three hook entries of
`.claude/settings.json` as the [template README](vault-template/README.md#what-is-enforced-and-what-is-not)
describes. In PowerShell, use these equivalents:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kuuratsanik/second-brain-os.git
Copy-Item -Recurse second-brain-os\vault-template $HOME\brain

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\brain\.claude, $HOME\brain\scripts | Out-Null

Copy-Item -Recurse second-brain-os\agents   $HOME\brain\.claude\agents
foreach ($f in 'chat_export_to_md','dashboard','graph_export','link_check','vault_search','vault_stats') {
  Copy-Item "second-brain-os\scripts\$f.py" $HOME\brain\scripts\
}
Remove-Item $HOME\brain\.claude\skills\README.md, $HOME\brain\.claude\commands\README.md, $HOME\brain\.claude\agents\README.md

Set-Location $HOME\brain
git init
git add .gitignore CLAUDE.md README.md templates wiki projects output journal archive raw .obsidian `
  .claude/settings.json .claude/hooks .claude/skills .claude/commands .claude/agents scripts
git commit -m "Initial vault"
python .claude\hooks\test_guard.py

claude
```

The vault must be its own git repository, not a folder inside another one. The
template's safety rails commit a checkpoint before any destructive step and one
commit per run, and the agent will not run `git init` for you or touch a parent
repository. The `.gitignore` in the template already keeps `raw/workspace/`
(email, chat, docs, calendar) and editor state out of git, and the first commit
names its paths instead of using `git add .` so nothing unreviewed goes in. It
includes `.obsidian/` (the template's Obsidian preset), `.claude/` (settings,
hooks, skills, commands, agents) and `scripts/`: the
vault's agent setup is worth versioning, and a revert then covers it too. The
template's `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/guard.py` are what turn
some of the rules in `CLAUDE.md` into enforced ones. They arrive with the
`vault-template` copy, and the later `cp` commands add to `.claude/` without
replacing them. See [what is enforced](vault-template/README.md#what-is-enforced-and-what-is-not). `raw` is included so
the empty subfolders are tracked; `raw/workspace/` stays ignored.

The `scripts/` copy is only the six vault scripts, not the site builders
(`build_*.py`), and it is what lets `/metrics`, `/health` and `/graph-export` run
`scripts/vault_stats.py` and friends from inside the vault. On Windows, see the
[Windows](#windows) subsection above.

**Or install the kit as a plugin.** Instead of the `cp -r` lines for `skills/`,
`commands/` and `agents/`, add this repo as a plugin marketplace. Still copy
`vault-template` (the rules and the guard live there), and copy the six vault
scripts (the `scripts/` lines of the block above) so they run without a
permission prompt:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add kuuratsanik/second-brain-os
claude plugin install second-brain@second-brain-os
```

Commands then run as `/second-brain:ingest` instead of `/ingest`, and
`claude plugin update` replaces `/install` for updates. Use one method per vault,
never both. [Which to use, and what changes](plugins/README.md#second-brain).

1. [Install Obsidian](docs/02-setup/obsidian-install-and-vault.md) and open
   the `~/brain` folder you just copied with "Open folder as vault"
2. [Set up Claude Code](docs/02-setup/claude-code-setup.md), in the terminal or
   the Code tab of the desktop app
3. [Connect over MCP](docs/02-setup/mcp-obsidian.md) if you want the agent to
   reach the vault from anywhere. Optional, skip it on day one
4. [Get interviewed for your CLAUDE.md](docs/02-setup/claude-md.md) instead of
   writing it by hand
5. [Set up the two layers](docs/02-setup/vault-structure.md): a wiki for what
   you know, projects for what you are doing
6. [Scope down to one project](docs/02-setup/project-scoping.md) when you want
   to ship something
7. Install the [Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper), clip an article to
   `raw/clippings/`, run `/ingest`
8. [Connect live data](docs/02-setup/live-data.md): calendar, email, chat
9. [Put maintenance on a schedule](docs/06-agents/scheduled-maintenance.md) and
   wake up to a vault that filed itself

Then feed it ten more sources before judging it. The graph is not interesting
at five pages and it is hard to look away from at fifty.

Full walkthrough: [Setup](docs/02-setup/README.md).

## How it works

```
   you                    raw/                 agent                 wiki/
 ┌───────┐          ┌──────────────┐      ┌────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
 │ clip  │  ──────> │ articles     │ ───> │  ingest    │ ───> │ sources/     │
 │ save  │          │ transcripts  │      │  extract   │      │ concepts/    │
 │ dump  │          │ pdfs         │      │  link      │      │ entities/    │
 └───────┘          │ chat exports │      │  lint      │      │ synthesis/   │
                    └──────────────┘      └────────────┘      └──────────────┘
                                                │                     │
                                                │   ask anything      │
                                                └─────────────────────┘
```

Raw material is an archive you never read. The wiki is the artifact, written in
plain language, one idea per page, densely linked. New sources update existing
pages instead of piling up beside them, which is why the vault gets better as
it grows rather than just bigger.

Alongside the wiki sits a project layer: one folder per project, each with its
own `CLAUDE.md` and an `Inputs / Process / Outputs / Feedback` pipeline. The
wiki holds what you know, the projects hold what you are doing, and they feed
each other. [The two layers](docs/01-concepts/two-layers.md) covers why keeping
them separate matters more than it sounds.

## What is in here

| Folder | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | The guide. Ten sections, from the concept to troubleshooting |
| [`docs/course-*/`](docs/course-0-map/README.md) | The agents course: seven modules, prompt to production |
| [`docs/track-*/`](docs/track-graph/README.md) | Five handbooks on the wider craft: graphs, Jev, harnesses, loops, evals |
| [`vault-template/`](vault-template/) | An opinionated starter vault, tuned for an agent that works without asking first, for several domains (work, learning, personal, creative, self-improvement, systems) and for notes in more than one language. It ships with no personal facts: the [CLAUDE.md interview](docs/02-setup/claude-md.md) fills in your profile |
| [`skills/`](skills/README.md) | 29 agent skills, one per workflow in the guide |
| [`commands/`](commands/README.md) | 78 slash commands, scoped entry points into those skills. The scheduling command is `/maintenance-schedule`, so it does not shadow Claude Code's built-in `/schedule` |
| [`agents/`](agents/README.md) | 6 subagents, four of them read-only by design |
| [`plugins/`](plugins/README.md) | Claude Code plugins — the course's tools, installable in two commands |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/README.md) | Dependency-free Python for link checking, stats, graph export, search and a health dashboard |
| [`resources/`](resources/README.md) | Tools, repos, papers and reading worth your time |
| [`examples/`](examples/README.md) | A fictional demo vault with link-check and stats output |

## The guide

Ten sections, 65 pages, written to be followed rather than skimmed. From the
concept through setup, capture, structure, the graph, automation, retrieval,
publishing, and what to do when each of them breaks.

| Section | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Concepts](docs/01-concepts/README.md) | what the pattern is and why the old note systems died|
| [Setup](docs/02-setup/README.md) | Obsidian, Claude Code, `CLAUDE.md`, MCP, projects, git|
| [Ingestion](docs/03-ingestion/README.md) | articles, video, PDFs, chat exports, voice, backfilling|
| [Structuring](docs/04-structuring/README.md) | page types, linking rules, schema, contradictions|
| [Graphs](docs/05-graphs/README.md) | what the graph is for, typed links, GraphRAG, metrics|
| [Agents](docs/06-agents/README.md) | roles, schedules, hooks, guardrails|
| [Retrieval](docs/07-retrieval/README.md) | query patterns, search, context budget|
| [Outputs](docs/08-outputs/README.md) | writing, reports, publishing, learning|
| [Maintenance](docs/09-maintenance/README.md) | linting, review cadence, git, privacy, scaling|
| [Troubleshooting](docs/10-troubleshooting/README.md) | the failures everyone hits, with fixes|

## The agents course

Seven modules from a single prompt to a production agent, built on Google's
agent whitepapers and the five-layer frame: what the agent sees, who decides
the next step, who sorts the incoming work, what it can reach, and how you
know it works. Theory with sources, a practice page in every module, and a
day-one plan at the end.

| Module | What it teaches |
|---|---|
| [0 · The map](docs/course-0-map/README.md) | what an agent is, the five layers, agents vs workflows |
| [1 · Context](docs/course-1-context/README.md) | attention, caching, the four places, sessions and memory |
| [2 · Loop](docs/course-2-loop/README.md) | goal, checker, stop rule, budget; the production hybrid |
| [3 · The gate](docs/course-3-gate/README.md) | cheap decisions first: classifiers, System One models |
| [4 · Harness](docs/course-4-harness/README.md) | containment, guides, sensors, permissions |
| [5 · Evals](docs/course-5-evals/README.md) | behavioural checks on traces, judged judges, golden sets |
| [6 · Production](docs/course-6-production/README.md) | gateways, tracing, cost, security, the day-one plan |

The course ships its own tools as a [Claude Code plugin](plugins/README.md) —
a context auditor, a goal-test generator, a gate finder, a harness auditor,
an evals bootstrapper and a loop critic, each doing one module's practice
page in your repo:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add kuuratsanik/second-brain-os
claude plugin install agents-course@second-brain-os
```

## The handbooks

Everything above is the second brain. The handbooks are the wider craft of
building with agents — separate subjects, deliberately compact: eight or nine
pages each, current as of September 2026, and every one ends in a hands-on
build you can finish in an evening.

| Handbook | What it covers | The build |
|---|---|---|
| [Knowledge graphs](docs/track-graph/README.md) | GraphRAG, extraction pipelines, stores, wikilinks-as-graph | a queryable graph layer over your own vault |
| [Jev engineering](docs/track-jev/README.md) | System One models: typed decisions with confidence instead of text | a confidence-gated router, ready for Jev when access lands |
| [Agent harnesses](docs/track-harness/README.md) | the loop, tools, context engineering, MCP, the landscape | a working harness in ~150 lines |
| [Loop engineering](docs/track-loop/README.md) | stop conditions, critics, context hygiene, unattended runs | an overnight loop with a ratchet and a morning report |
| [Eval engineering](docs/track-evals/README.md) | golden sets, LLM judges, agent trajectories, CI gates | your first eval suite, wired into CI |

Read them on the site: [handbooks on kuuratsanik.github.io](https://kuuratsanik.github.io/second-brain-os/).

## Design decisions

This setup is opinionated. The three rules that matter most, and why:

**Nothing is ingested until it is linked.** A page that lands unconnected is
invisible within a week. Linking is the entire value, so it happens in the same
run or the ingest is not finished.

**Contradictions are recorded, never overwritten.** When a new source disagrees
with a page, both positions stay, with dates and sources. The history of what
you believed and why is the one thing your vault has that a search engine does
not.

**No vector database until you need one.** A personal corpus is small and
already structured. Structured pages plus links answer questions that chunk
similarity cannot, at zero infrastructure cost. [When RAG earns its
place](docs/07-retrieval/rag-on-top.md) covers the threshold.

## Who this is for

Anyone who reads a lot and retains less than they want to: researchers,
engineers, writers, students, people who watch three hours of technical video a
week and remember none of it.

It is not for team wikis, it is not a Notion replacement, and it will not
organise a vault you never add to.

## Portability

Everything here is markdown files, wikilinks and `SKILL.md` files. It works with
Claude Code, and with any agent that reads files. Obsidian is a viewer for the
graph, not a dependency. If you walk away from every tool named in this repo,
you keep the folder and everything in it.

| Source | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| **[Karpathy's llm-wiki gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)** (4 Apr 2026) | The pattern everything here builds on. Short, written as an idea file to paste into your agent rather than as a spec. Read it first. |
| **[From Local to Global: GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130)** arXiv:2404.16130 | Why chunk retrieval fails on questions about a whole corpus, which is exactly what people want from a second brain. Code: [microsoft/graphrag](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag). |
| **[HippoRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831)** arXiv:2405.14831 | Graph retrieval with personalised PageRank for multi-hop questions. The closest published analogue of an agent walking links outward. |
| **[Lost in the Middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)** arXiv:2307.03172, TACL | The empirical reason not to paste your whole vault into context, and the basis for the [context budget](docs/07-retrieval/context-budget.md) rules. |
| **[Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org)** | Evergreen notes, written in public. Also the strongest argument against this approach: if the writing is the thinking, delegating it means not doing it. |
| **How to Take Smart Notes** (Ahrens) | Zettelkasten. Atomic notes and dense linking still hold; the manual labour is what killed it for most people. |
| **Building a Second Brain** (Forte) | Where the term comes from, and PARA. Most of the book is about maintenance work an agent removes. |

## Skills and other implementations

This repo ships **29 skills, 78 commands, 6 subagents and 6 scripts**: one skill
per workflow in the guide, and a command for every scoped version of it you would
actually run.

Other implementations, counted the same way. A repo shipping fifteen skills
counts as fifteen. Stars from the GitHub API, as of 5 October 2026. Counts for
other repositories were read from their folder listings or READMEs on the same
date.
